# Cross-compilation

As long as you have the compilation tools for your target architecture/system,
you should be able to cross-compile by using meson.

Please reference the [Cross
compilation](https://mesonbuild.com/Cross-compilation.html) page on the Meson
site.

You can also have a look at
[BUILDING.md](https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/blob/dev/BUILDING.md) for an
example about cross-compilation for Android.
